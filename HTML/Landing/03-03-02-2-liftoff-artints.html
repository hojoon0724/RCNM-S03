            <p>
              With playing that is “fierce and lyrical” and works that are “other-worldly” <i>(The Strad)</i> and
              “evocative” <i>(New York Times)</i>, <b>Jessica Meyer</b> is an award-winning composer and violist whose
              passionate musicianship radiates accessibility and emotional clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the start of her composition career in 2014 at age 40, Meyer's compositions have viscerally explored
              the wide palette of colors available to each instrument while combining techniques inspired by her
              experiences as a contemporary and period instrumentalist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her works have been performed in venues from the Kennedy Center to Carnegie Hall, by musicians of the
              Minnesota Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, and by orchestras around the country. Premieres have

            <p>
              Upcoming premieres include a work for MET tenor Paul Appleby and the Claremont Trio, a work for viola and
              piano commissioned by the Pre-College Department of The Juilliard School, and a new orchestral piece to be
