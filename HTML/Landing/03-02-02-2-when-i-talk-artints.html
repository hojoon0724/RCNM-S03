            <p>
              One of New York City’s most in demand percussionists, <b>Sean Ritenauer</b> has performed on Broadway, as
              a concerto soloist, for film and television, and with the world’s most prominent symphony orchestras. Well
              versed in classical, contemporary, and popular music styles, the Ohio native’s multi-genre fluency has led
              to his similarly disparate career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Ritenauer has become one of the industry’s most active commercial musicians, performing in
              award-winning television and film soundtracks like
              <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Tick, Tick… Boom!, A Dog’s Purpose</i>, <i>Zoolander 2,</i>and<i
                >Moonrise Kingdom,</i
              >
              with several other projects yet to be released including <i>White Noise</i> and <i>Salem’s Lot</i>. He
              made his Broadway debut on the 18-month national tour of <i>Hair</i>, followed by holding the percussion
              chair of <i>Something Rotten!</i> and <i>Pippin</i>on Broadway<i>.</i> As a substitute, he has performed
              in countless Broadway productions. Currently you can find Sean filling in for his esteemed colleagues at
              <i>MJ</i>, <i>Tina</i>, and<i>BeetleJuice</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ritenauer holds a deep affinity for classical repertoire, proudly serving as Principal Percussionist of
              the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra (AL) since 2016 (member since 2005). As a guest musician, Sean enjoys
              performing regularly with National Symphony Orchestra (D.C.), and the New York Philharmonic, whom he
              accompanied on tours of Europe (2017), Asia (2018), and Germany (2022), and in residencies in Vail and
              Shanghai. In 2022, Ritenauer joined the Cabrillo Festival Orchestra (Santa Cruz, CA) in his first season
              as a member of the percussion section.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra, he has often appeared as a concerto soloist, including the
              second-ever performance of Andy Akiho’s <i>Percussion Concerto</i> in January 2020. The Akiho marked
              Ritenauer’s third solo appearance with the orchestra, joining performances of Gregory Vajda’s
              <i>Drums, Drums, Drums</i>and Jennifer Higdon’s <i>Percussion Concerto</i>. Reviewing his interpretation
              of the Higdon, <i>The Huntsville Times</i> praised Ritenauer for “mesmerizing dexterity”, and recounted
              “an immediate standing ovation” from the audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps most at home as an artistic leader and chamber musician, Sean co-founded Rocket City New Music in
              2021. Determined to make Huntsville, AL a meeting place for the elite in contemporary music, Sean has
              combined his affection for music by living composers with his passion for curating performance
              opportunities for like minded artists from across the country. In addition to performing with his own
              organization, Sean is frequently featured as a chamber musician with the world famous Mark Morris Dance
              Group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ritenauer also places a premium on excellence as an educator. As Adjunct Assistant Professor of Percussion
              at Hofstra University, he teaches privately and is the director of the Hofstra Percussion Ensemble. As a
              private teacher, his Manhattan-based studio features alumni admitted to the country’s top music programs,
              including Juilliard, Eastman, and the New England Conservatory to name a few. Mr. Ritenauer strives to
              find the <i>ruthless self-critic</i> and the <i>careless artist</i> in all of his students in an attempt
              to help them become generous educators and marketable musicians.
            </p>
            <p>
              A proud graduate of the Interlochen Arts Academy, Mr. Ritenauer holds degrees in Classical Percussion
              (B.M.) and Orchestral Performance (M.M.) from the Manhattan School of Music. He resides in New York City
              with his wife, the oboist Hsuan-Fong Chen. They share a home with their cockapoo, Hiro.

              Daisy Press’ distinctive and singular voice carries through wild, diverse artistic worlds with its
              plainspoken emotional fingerprint, and, when left to its own devices, gravitates towards incantation.
              Daisy is a prolific creator and performer in New York City nightlife, and is a prominent soloist in
              experimental classical music in the US and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>In September 2022 she released her debut solo album “You Are</p>
            <p>
              The Flower,” the first volume of chants to emerge from her long-term relationship with the 12-century
              German saint Hildegard of
            </p>
            <p>
              Bingen (Hildy). This album’s untraditional approach received high praise from NPR: “Daisy Press reinvents
              Hildegard.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In Europe, Daisy sings regularly as a soloist with Vienna-based ensembles Klangforum Wien and Phace, and
              in Germany with the Aleph Guitar Quartet. There she has performed works of composers Bernhard Lang, Martin
              Smolka, Rebecca Saunders, Claude Vivier, György
            </p>
            <p>Ligeti, and Fausto Romitelli.</p>
            <p>
              In January 2023, Daisy “blew away the entire evening” at the Vienna Konzerthaus with her “outstanding,”
              “dazzling” coloratura in Ligeti’s “Mysteries of the Macabre” with Klangforum Wien. For her recording and
              performance of Morton Feldman’s “Three Voices” at the Museum of Modern Art, Press was hailed by the New
              York Times as “intrepid” and “passionate.” With So Percussion, she has performed multiple works
            </p>
            <p>
              of Steve Reich, including “Drumming” and “Music for 18 Musicians” worldwide. The Times also noted the
              “winning subtlety and understatement” of her performance of George Crumb’s “Unto the Hills” with So.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Brooklyn’s notorious House of Yes, Daisy has served as singer-in- residence. In the pop world, Daisy
              once served as the lead backing singer/dancer for Chromeo, and appeared with them
            </p>
            <p>
              on Letterman, Conan, Fallon, at Lollapalooza, and at Coachella. On Broadway, Daisy originated her own role
              in “The Devouring” at the Times
            </p>
            <p>
              Square Edition, where she nightly sang her divine-feminine re- embodiment of Nine Inch Nails’ 90s banger
              “Closer.”
