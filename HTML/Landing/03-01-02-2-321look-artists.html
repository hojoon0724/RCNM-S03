            <div class="featherlight-name">Mary Mackenzie</div>
            <div class="featherlight-instrument">Voice</div>
            <p>
              Critically acclaimed as “a soprano of extraordinary agility and concentration” by
              <i>The New York Times</i>, soprano Mary Mackenzie has emerged as one of contemporary music’s most
              compelling storytellers. With a career that has taken her to performances in 11 U.S. States and Washington
              D.C., as well as a seasoned discography spanning eleven years, Ms. Mackenzie is particularly known for her
              evocative chamber music performances. For her efforts, she has earned praise for a “sensational, epically
              unsettling” rendition of George Crumb by the <i>Boston Globe</i> and her “mystifying” vocal effects by
              <i>The Financial Times</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples of some of her most immersive work to date includes several “one-woman” performances, like the
              United States premiere of Héctor Parra’s monodrama <i>Hypermusic: Ascension</i> at the Guggenheim Museum,
              a highly technological experience which utilized Harvard professor of theoretical physics Lisa Randall as
              librettist. At the Bravo! Vail Festival, Ms. Mackenzie performed and designed the storyline for a
              cabaret-style, costumed and staged rendition of <i>De Leeuw - Im wunderschoenen Monat mai</i>, a
              Pierrot-style “recomposed” adaptation of works by Schumann and Schubert, with new music collective Le
              Train Bleu—she has since continued to perform the work with the Redlands Symphony and with The Knights
              ensemble. Elsewhere, she has performed chamber music with American Contemporary Music Ensemble, the
              Chameleon Arts Ensemble, Ekmeles, the Da Capo Chamber Players, Collage New Music, Fulcrum Point, and the
              Talea Ensemble, among many others.
            </p>
            <p>
              In keeping with her contemporary bonafides, she has performed leading roles in world premieres of numerous
              operas, including as Sister Leonide (<i>Mata Hari</i> by Matt Marks), Despina (<i>Cosi faran tutti</i> by
              Jonathan Dawe), and Angelica (<i>Cracked Orlando</i> by Jonathan Dawe). Ms. Mackenzie finds particular
              enjoyment in the collaborative element of designing new work in tandem with the fresh ideas of emerging
              composers, and in that vein has premiered over 20 works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Mackenzie’s discography includes five albums of collaborations with a bevy of modern composers. On
              Albany Records, she has frequently collaborated with the MacArthur Grant awardee composer John Harbison on
              albums such as <i>Vocalisms: Songs of Daniel Crozier, John Harbison, James Primosch, and Ned Rorem</i>;
              <i>Closer to My Own Life</i> with the Albany Symphony; <i>Songs After Hours</i> (a World Premiere). Her
              other album work includes <i>Cathedral Music</i> with The 21st Century Consort,
              <i>Louis Karchin: To the Sun and Stars</i> on Bridge Records, and <i>The Opera America Songbook</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a soloist, Ms. Mackenzie has collaborated with the Albany Symphony, Phoenix Symphony, American Symphony
              Orchestra, the Juilliard Percussion Ensemble, and the Borromeo String Quartet. Particularly dear to her
              heart was a performance of Boulez’s Improvisations sur Mallarmé Nos. 1 & 2 for the composer’s 85th
              birthday celebration at Columbia University’s Miller Theatre, as well as a performance of Elliott Carter’s
              <i>Warble for Lilac Time</i> with the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Occasionally found in
              traditional opera productions, Ms. Mackenzie made her professional opera debut as Despina (<i
                >Così fan tutte</i
              >) at Madison Opera, and has appeared as the soprano soloist (<i>Carmina Burana</i>) with both the Grant
              Park Symphony Orchestra and the Phoenix Symphony.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally from Madison, Mary Mackenzie holds education from The Manhattan School of Music (M.M.) and the
              Cleveland Institute of Music (B.M., Professional Studies Certificate). She lives with her husband Barry in
              Boston, where she enjoys hiking, cooking, photography, and gardening.

              the Huntsville Symphony (AL), and is now the principal second violin of Des Moines Metro Opera. Her love
              of chamber music has inspired her to found several chamber music ensembles and series in the past. In 2018
              she co-founded a new string quartet in Birmingham, Iron City Strings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Born and raised in Costa Rica, currently calling Chicago home. Dalia is a sound explorer. Often using
              flutes as a basis for explorations, but also no stranger to using voice and the sounds of the world around
              her. Dalia strives to intuitively create music as a performer, improviser, and collaborator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dalia believes in forging deep connections between her, collaborators, and audience which allows to
              communicate the essence of a work at the highest level of excellence and whenever possible invite
              community participation in the creation of works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Collaboration and aesthetic variety are at the center of her work as a soloist and chamber musician. It is
              through collaboration and work with composers such as Mesias Maiguashca, Julio Estrada, Fernanda Aoki

              Ayub, Julia Wolfe, David Lang, Pablo Santiago Chin, that her work as a soloist and creator of sounds has
              grown. Dalia’s work with ensembles, such as Fonema Consort where she is a founding member, and as a guest
              flutist with Eighth Blackbird, Fulcrum Point, Fifth House, Unsupervised, and Chicago Composers Orchestra,
              offer an active platform for chamber music collaborations.
